# Train – Training

> This project is a **programming playground** to practice and strengthen skills in C++, C, data structures, systems, and networking.  
> It is intended for learning purposes and skill-building, not for production use.

## 🧠 Project Goals
- Improve proficiency in **C++ and C**
- Understand **memory management** (stack vs heap, malloc/free, new/delete)
- Practice **data structures**: arrays, vectors, linked lists, stacks, queues
- Explore **networking concepts** and file handling
- Write **clean, robust, and well-documented code**
- Manage version control with **Git/GitHub**
